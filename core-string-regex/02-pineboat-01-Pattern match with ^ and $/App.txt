Pattern match End to End
That paves the road to pattern match start to end, you might as well call it end to end.

let e=/^[0-9]$/
e.test("42"); //false - NO!
e.test("The answer is 42"); //false
e.test("7"); //true 
Surprisingly, the first one failed when we added ^ and $.

/^[0-9]$/ in plain English reads like, go to the start of the string. Look for a single numeral from the character set. Check if the string ends right there. That’s the reason the last entry returned true. It is just a single number, start to end.

That’s not what we wanted. We wanted to test if the string had one or more numerals.

We are very close. One last thing we need to learn is, how to instruct the pattern to look for more than one character in the set.
