The plus (+) looks at question mark and remarks, “I’m impressed, but your focus is so binary!”. And takes the stage to show off.

/a+/.test("a"); //true
/a+/.test("aa"); //true 
/a+/.test("ba"); //true!
/^a+$/.test("aa"); //true

/a+/.test(""); //false
/a+/.test("b"); //false
/^a+$/.test("ab"); //false
Remember what plus (+) said? It can match one or more occurrences of preceeding pattern.

All those returning true have one or more a. We even managed to get a whole string comprised only of a in the last one that returned true with /^a+$/.

false should make sense now, but a word on the last one that returned false. /^a+$/ looks for a start to end, no other characters allowed. Which is why ab failed the test.
